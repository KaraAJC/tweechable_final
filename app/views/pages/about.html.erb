<h2>Why did you build Tweechable?</h2>
<p>
  We're working on a Twitter service called <a href="https://twitter.com/tweechable">@Tweechable</a> that can be loaded with educational content on specific issues important to affinity groups that get a common set of ignorant questions on Twitter.  For example, instead of having to explain respectability politics to strangers who criticize protests as “angry,” you can simply ask <a href="https://twitter.com/tweechable">@Tweechable</a> to share information on the topic. <a href="https://twitter.com/tweechable">@Tweechable</a> will respond with a lesson and allow you to exit the conversation. Then you can to go back to living, relaxing, or doing whatever it was you were doing before getting so many questions and unsolicited opinions.

<h2>Here's an example exchange with a topic we've seen a lot here in Chicago:</h2>
<div class="jumbotron sample-tweets">
  <div class="tweet-col">
    <div class="col-text">
      Someone asks an ignorant question directed toward an activist

    <div class="sample-tweet">
      <%= image_tag "ignorant-avatar.jpg", class: "avatar" %>
      <div class="text">
        <span class="handle">@IgnorantTweeter</span>: Hey <span class="handle">@OverworkedActivist</span>, why are you so focused on police brutality in Chicago?
        Why aren’t you talking about black-on-black crime?
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tweet-col">
    <div class="col-text">
      The activist mentions <span class="handle">@tweechable</span>, which provides a lesson.

        <span class="handle">@tweechable</span>: Sure, >90% blacks homicides are other blacks, but it's the same for every race in the US.  82% of white

        <span class="handle">@tweechable</span>: also consider that many people -- black, white, others, are devoting their lives to interrupting violence
        in cities.  We honor their efforts, but our focus is police violence. <a href="http://bit.ly/BoBViol2">bit.ly/BoBViol2</a>

        <span class="handle">@tweechable</span>: if you have other questions on the issue, i'm happy to help further, or you can explore the syllabus

<p>
  Any user affiliated with our project could generate a syllabus for any content area through a web interface we're
  building - no technical knowledge is required.  We've heard feedback and want to extend this to multiple affinity
  groups: women who experience harassment and ignorance; Muslims who experience xenophobia and ignorance; etc.

<h2>The hope is that there will be impact in three areas:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Self-care of activists</b> - rather than stress over the time spent responding to haters OR the frustration at having
    them continue to spew ignorance, they can rest easier and focus on more important things (“save your energy
    so you can fight the system”)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Targets of our Tweet bursts</b> - the direct targets of the Tweet bursts would be educated
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Onlookers to the discussion</b> - anyone following the thread will have more targeted resources and education about the issue
  </li>
</ul>
